\title{Obtain a partition using a Greedy-type algorithm}
\usage{
GRDTP_partition_tdv(m, k, verify = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{m}{A \code{matrix}, i.e. a phytosociological table of 0s (absences) and 1s (presences), where rows correspond to taxa and columns correspond to relevés.}

\item{k}{A \code{numeric} giving the number of desired groups.}

\item{verify}{A \code{logical}. If \code{TRUE} (the default) the function verifies if basic features of \code{m} data structure are met. Otherwise if \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
A \verb{numeric vector}, which length is the same as the number of columns of m, with numbers from 1 to \code{k}, representing the group to which
the respective column was ascribed.
}
\description{
This function obtains a partition of the columns of a given phytosociological matrix, aiming at high values of the
Total Differential Value (TDV), implementing a Greedy-type algorithm.
}
\details{
Given the phytosociological table \code{m} (rows corresponding to taxa and columns corresponding to relevés), this function
uses a Greedy-type algorithm (a simplified version of the Greedy algorithm) to obtain a k-partition (\code{k}, defined by the user) of the columns of \code{m}, aiming at high values of TVD.
The algorithm operates in the following way: Firstly, \code{k} columns are selected randomly to work as seeds for each one of the
desired \code{k} groups. Secondly, one of the remaining columns is selected randomly and added to the partition group which maximizes
the upcoming TDV. This second step is repeated until all columns are placed in a group of the k-partition.

Being a simplified version of the Greedy algorithm, it is expected to perform faster than \code{\link{GRASP_partition_tdv}}, yet
returning worse partitions in terms of TDV. For the (true) Greedy algorithm see \code{\link{GRASP_partition_tdv}}.
See \code{\link{tdv}} for an explanation on the TDV of a phytosociological table.
