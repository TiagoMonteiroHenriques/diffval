\title{Interactively explore a tabulation of a phytosociological matrix.}
\usage{
explore_tabulation(tab, palette = "Vik")
}
\arguments{
\item{tab}{A \code{list} as returned by the \code{\link{tabulation}} function.}

\item{palette}{A \code{character} with the name of the colour palette (one of \code{\link[grDevices]{hcl.pals}}\verb{()}) to be passed to \code{\link[grDevices]{hcl.colors}}. Defaults to "Vik".}
}
\value{
Returns invisibly, although it prints taxa names on the console upon the user click on the figure.
}
\description{
This function plots an interactive image of a tabulation.
}
\details{
The function explore.tabulation accepts an object returned by the \code{\link{tabulation}} function, plotting a condensed image
of the respective tabulated matrix, permitting the user to click on the coloured blocks and receive the respective list of taxa names on
the console.
}
\examples{

#getting the Taxus baccata forests data set
data(taxus_bin)
#creating a group partition, as presented in the original article of the data set
groups <- rep(c(1,2,3), c(3,11,19))

#removing taxa occurring in only one relevÃ© in order to
#reproduce exactly the example in the original article of the data set
taxus_bin_wmt <- taxus_bin[rowSums(taxus_bin) > 1,]

#sorts the phytosociological table, putting exclusive taxa at the top and
#plots an image of it
tabul <- tabulation(taxus_bin_wmt, groups, taxa.names = rownames(taxus_bin_wmt),
 plot.im = "normal", palette = "Zissou 1")

\dontrun{
#this creates an interactive plot (where you can click)
explore_tabulation(tabul, palette = "Zissou 1")
}
