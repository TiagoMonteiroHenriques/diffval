Description: Find, visualize and explore patterns of 'differential taxa'
    in vegetation data (namely in a phytosociological table), using the
    Differential Value (DiffVal). DiffVal captures the degree of
    exclusiveness of a taxon to each of the different clusters of relevés
    of a sorted phytosociological table. The patterns of 'differential
    taxa' are searched through mathematical optimization algorithms,
    resorting the table while maximizing the sum of the DiffVal for all
    the taxa in the table, i.e. maximizing the Total Differential Value
    (TotDiffVal or TDV). Ultimately, TDV optimization aims at obtaining
    classifications of vegetation data based on 'differential taxa', as in
    the traditional phytosociological (or geobotanical) approach. The
    'Gurobi' optimizer, as well as the R package 'gurobi', can be
    installed from <https://www.gurobi.com/products/gurobi-optimizer/>.
    The vignette "Gurobi Installation Guide", from package 'prioritizr',
    is usefull and can be found here:
