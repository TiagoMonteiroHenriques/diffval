Description: Find, visualize and explore patterns of differential taxa in
    a phytosociological table (vegetation data), using the Differential
    Value (DiffVal) index. The patterns are searched through mathematical
    optimization algorithms, maximizing the sum of the DiffVal index for
    all the taxa in the table, i.e. the Total Differential Value
    (TotDiffVal or TDV).  Ultimately, the TDV optimization aims at
    obtaining classifications of vegetation data based on differential
    taxa, i.e. taxa that are exclusive of a certain group (or exclusive of
    some of the groups), as in the traditional phytosociological (or
    geobotanical) approach.
