Description: Find, visualize and explore patterns of 'differential taxa'
    in vegetation data (namely in a phytosociological table), using the
    Differential Value (DiffVal). Patterns are searched through
    mathematical optimization algorithms. Ultimately, TDV optimization
    aims at obtaining classifications of vegetation data based on
    'differential taxa', as in the traditional geobotanical approach. The
    'Gurobi' optimizer, as well as the R package 'gurobi', can be
    installed from <https://www.gurobi.com/products/gurobi-optimizer/>.
    The useful vignette "Gurobi Installation Guide", from package
    'prioritizr', can be found here:
